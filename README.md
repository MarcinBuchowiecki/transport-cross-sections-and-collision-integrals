# transport-cross-sections-and-collision-integrals
transport cross sections (momentum-transfer cross sections, diffusion cross sections and higher moments) and related collision integrals for colliding atoms and ions - classical mechanics approach


The approach is validated on the case of Lennard-Jones potential - high quality collision integrals are given in Kim & Monroe (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999114003647?via%3Dihub).
